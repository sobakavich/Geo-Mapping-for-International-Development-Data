# International-Aid-Data-GEO-Field-Mapping

This files presents a mash up of available Geographical coding relevant to those conducting research into Foreign Assistance, particularly
those examining USG data on such. It is not comprehensive of all donors but highlights GEO mapping related to data presented through
Foreign Aid Explorer, Foreignassistance.gov, Grants.gov and USAID business forecasts.

The information in this file gathers and attempts to make sense and a map of the following:
1. ISO Country and Regional Coding
2. US Government Foreign Assistance Geographical Coding
3. IATI Geographical Coding
4. DAC/CRS Geographical Coding
5. UNDP Human Development Index Scoring
6. World Bank Income Group Classification
7. Latitude and Longitude for country capitals or a major location for geocoding reference

The location of relevant International Aid/Foreign Assistance locations is broken down in the first column to a standardardized
author-selected name, and each data point above is mapped to that.
ISO, IATI, DAC/CRS, and USG regional information is mapped out to the author-selected location name, and where necessary location names 
presented by the USG (in publically available CSV downloads) that are regional-specific as opposed to countries have been broken down
into subregions as per relevant ISO entries at the author's best efforts of creating uniformity.

The entire  document is keyed to ISO-ALPHA-3. IATI v3 is used where IATI is mentioned. USGOV fields are taken directly from CSV download
at FAE and FASG. DAC information comes from the DAC codelist most current as of this repository creation, as well as the Creditor
Reporting System (online drop-downs specifically) where needed. When data points have been unavailable in each resource, the fallback
presented in most cases is the ISO terminology if the author was able to find it. If not, then other standardized resources have been
used where applicable. These include D-track, international calling codes, or other quasi authoritative standards.

HDI and Income group was added for no real reason other than I thought it would be a nice reference to have synced to the GEO mapping
for future research needs.

The author accepts no liability for any factual, data, format or other errors in the documents. The item was created from public
information but one person staring at spreadsheets, OpenRefine, EasyMorph and Talend for a couple weeks off and on. It most likely contains some errors and should not be used for a production-level project without significant review and testing.

It is intended to be a cheat-sheet, experiment and potential support to those conducting research or simply interested in this area.
Please feel free to post any corrections you might see as comments or committ changes if you like.

All data that went into this is public, and so this is too! Information wants to be free.

Cheers.
